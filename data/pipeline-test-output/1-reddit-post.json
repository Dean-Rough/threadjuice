  "selftext": "So here's the situation. My (28M) sister (26F) just announced her wedding date, and it's the EXACT same weekend as San Diego Comic-Con. I've been going to SDCC for 10 years straight - it's basically my Christmas, New Year's, and birthday rolled into one glorious nerdy weekend.\n\nI already have my 4-day pass (which I fought tooth and nail to get when they went on sale), hotel booked, and I'm part of a group cosplay that we've been planning for months. We're doing the entire Fellowship of the Ring and I'm Aragorn.\n\nWhen I told my sister I couldn't make it, she completely lost it. She said I'm choosing \"stupid comics\" over family. I tried to explain that:\n1. I've had these plans for months\n2. SDCC tickets are non-refundable and impossible to get\n3. She KNOWS how important this is to me\n\nShe could have picked literally any other weekend in the summer. Now my whole family is calling me selfish and my mom is threatening to disown me. But here's the kicker - my sister has NEVER supported my interests. She's called my hobby \"childish\" more times than I can count.\n\nAITA for standing my ground here?\n\nEdit: For those asking, she announced the date 3 months before the wedding. She claims the venue only had that date available, but I find that hard to believe.\n\nEdit 2: Yes, I realize family is important. But so is mental health and having things that bring you joy in life.",
