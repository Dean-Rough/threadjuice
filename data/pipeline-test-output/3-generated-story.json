      "content": "Look, The Terry understands the sanctity of Comic-Con. It's not just a convention - it's a bloody religious experience for those who worship at the altar of pop culture. Our protagonist here has been making this hajj for a decade, and now suddenly sister dearest decides to schedule her nuptials during the high holy days of nerdom? That's either weapons-grade ignorance or calculated emotional warfare."

      "heading": "The Fellowship Cannot Be Broken",
      "content": "Can we just appreciate the beautiful tragedy of having to choose between being Aragorn at Comic-Con and attending a wedding? The man's got a commitment to his Fellowship! You can't just replace Aragorn with some random bloke from Craigslist. That's like replacing the groom at the wedding - technically possible, but defeats the entire purpose."

      "heading": "Family Dynamics: A Critical Analysis",
      "content": "Here's where The Terry's cynicism meter starts pinging like a metal detector at a cutlery convention. Sister who's spent years mocking his interests suddenly can't understand why he won't drop everything for her big day? The same sister who called his hobbies 'childish'? That's rich enough to fund a small nation's economy."

      "heading": "The Verdict from Mount Doom",
      "content": "The Terry's going with NTA, but with a caveat. Yes, family is important. Yes, weddings are once-in-a-lifetime events (theoretically). But respect is a two-way street, and you can't spend years dismissing someone's passions then act shocked when they prioritize those passions over your event. If she wanted Aragorn at her wedding, she should have treated him like the King of Gondor all along, not like some basement-dwelling orc."

  "conclusion": "Sometimes the real asshole is the family dynamics we endured along the way. May the Force be with you, you beautiful nerdy bastard.",
