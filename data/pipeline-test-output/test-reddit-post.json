  "selftext": "I (25F) live with my roommate (27M) who recently got into cooking. The problem is, they're experimenting with some really strong-smelling foods that make the whole apartment reek. I finally told them yesterday that their cooking smells terrible and asked if they could open windows or use the exhaust fan. They got really upset and said I was being culturally insensitive. AITA?",
