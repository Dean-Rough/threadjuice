        "content": "The team building started normally enough. Puzzles to solve, clues to find, that artificial camaraderie that happens when adults are forced to pretend work is a game. But after the final puzzle was solved and the team cheered their victory, something became clear.\n\nThe door handle turned, but the door didn't open. The employees laughed it off at first—probably just part of the experience, right? Except ten minutes passed. Then twenty. The facilitator looked confused. The manager looked concerned."

When companies need to force enjoyment, it suggests they know something is fundamentally broken about the employee experience.\n\nThe fact that the escape room doors actually wouldn't open? That's not just poor planning—it's accidentally honest about how many people feel about their jobs."
