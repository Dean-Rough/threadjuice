'Real morning routines,' 'no-makeup selfies,' 'just woke up like this' content that resonates with her 2.3 million followers who crave genuine connection in an increasingly fake world.\n\nToo bad she forgot to check what was behind her when she hit record."

Bella's hair looked effortlessly tousled, her skin glowed with that perfect 'just woke up' luminescence her followers envied.\n\nBut in the background, just visible in the corner of her vanity mirror, was the telltale outline of a professional ring light. And next to it, what appeared to be a makeup artist's kit."
