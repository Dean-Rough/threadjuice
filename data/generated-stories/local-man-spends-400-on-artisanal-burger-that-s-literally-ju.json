He knows the difference between a good burger and a great one, understands why wagyu costs more than regular beef, and can spot a tourist trap from three blocks away.\n\nSo when 'Elevated Street' opened in his neighborhood promising 'artisanal interpretations of classic American comfort food,' he figured $32 for their signature burger might actually be worth it.",

        "content": "The burger arrived with appropriate fanfare. Artfully plated, perfectly constructed, served on what was definitely not a paper wrapper. Marcus took his first bite and... it was familiar. Too familiar.\n\nThat sauce. That exact combination of flavors. The way the pickles were cut. He'd tasted this exact burger before, but definitely not for $32."

        "content": "The artisanal food movement has created perfect cover for what amounts to elaborate price gouging. Slap 'elevated' or 'artisanal' on anything, and suddenly a 400% markup seems justified.\n\nBut this goes beyond overpriced food. It's about how marketing language has become so sophisticated that we can be convinced to pay premium prices for the exact same product we could get elsewhere for a fraction of the cost."
