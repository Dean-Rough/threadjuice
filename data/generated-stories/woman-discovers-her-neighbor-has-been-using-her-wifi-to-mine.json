        "content": "Sarah Patterson thought she was going crazy. For three years, her electricity bills had been climbing steadily, despite no changes to her usage patterns. No new appliances, no lifestyle changes, just mysteriously increasing costs that made her question everything from her meter to her sanity.\n\nThen she decided to check her WiFi settings.",

        "content": "What Sarah found in her router logs changed everything. Unknown devices. Massive data usage during hours when she was asleep. Traffic patterns that looked nothing like her Netflix-and-email lifestyle.\n\nA little detective work revealed the truth: her neighbor Bob, the guy who'd been 'so helpful' when she moved in three years ago, had somehow gained access to her network. Not just casual browsing access—full-scale cryptocurrency mining operation access."

        "content": "This isn't just about WiFi theft—it's about the erosion of basic trust in an increasingly connected world. When your neighbor can literally profit off your utilities without your knowledge, what does that say about digital privacy and consent?\n\nThe cryptocurrency angle makes it even more insidious. Bob wasn't just checking email on Sarah's dime; he was running a business operation that transferred the costs to an unknowing victim."

        "content": "Sarah changed her WiFi password and filed a police report. Bob moved out the following month, presumably to find new neighbors with better security practices. The electricity bill returned to normal, but the trust in neighborhood relationships? That's going to take longer to restore."
