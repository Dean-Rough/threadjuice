        "content": "Oh, buckle up, dear readers, because today's tale of petty justice is so beautifully crafted it belongs in a revenge hall of fame. We're diving into the story of a fed-up apartment dweller who decided that package theft deserved a special kind of punishment. Spoiler alert: it involves cat litter and the sweet, sweet sound of a thief getting exactly what they deserve.\n\nOur protagonist, let's call them the Package Avenger, lives in one of those apartment complexes where packages go to die. You know the type: shared mailroom, zero security, and apparently a resident kleptomaniac named Dave who thinks 'delivery for you' actually means 'free shopping for me.'\n\nFor months, Dave had been treating the mailroom like his personal Amazon warehouse. Security cameras caught him red-handed, but the building management's response was about as useful as a chocolate teapot. 'We need more evidence,' they said, while Dave continued his one-man crime spree."

Into Dave's grubby little hands like he'd won some kind of terrible lottery.\n\nBut instead of filing another useless complaint, the Package Avenger decided to get creative. Step one: Order something cheap online. Step two: Get a big box. Step three: Fill said box with used cat litter. Not the fresh stuff, mind you. We're talking about the full aromatic experience that only comes from actual cat usage.\n\nThe piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance? Writing 'EXPENSIVE ELECTRONICS' on the outside in big, tempting letters. It was like catnip for thieves, if catnip smelled like justice and poor life choices.\n\nSure enough, Dave took the bait faster than a seagull on a dropped chip. Our hero watched through their peephole as Dave carried his 'prize' home, probably already planning how to sell his latest haul."

Dave got exactly what he deserved: a box full of consequences that smell like his life choices.\n\nWhat makes this story even better is Dave's reaction. Instead of slinking away in shame, this absolute legend had the audacity to march up to our hero's door and demand an explanation. 'Did you put cat litter in MY package?' he asked. My package. The sheer entitlement is breathtaking.\n\nThis is what happens when someone's moral compass is so broken they forget which direction 'wrong' points. Dave was so confident in his thievery that he couldn't even pretend the package wasn't meant for him.\n\nThe beauty of this revenge is that it's completely self-selecting. Only someone stealing packages would ever discover the surprise inside. It's like a morality test that comes with its own punishment."

But when building management won't help and the police can't act, sometimes you have to get creative.\n\nOur Package Avenger didn't hurt anyone, didn't break any laws, and didn't even waste good cat litter (according to the comments). They just created a natural consequence for someone's terrible behavior.\n\nThe real question isn't whether this was justified. It's why more people aren't doing this. Dave learned a valuable lesson that day: if you're going to steal packages, maybe don't complain when they contain exactly what you deserve.\n\nWhat would you have done in this situation? Are you team Package Avenger or team 'that went too far'? Let us know, and remember: if you're thinking about stealing packages, maybe reconsider. You never know what surprises might be waiting inside."
