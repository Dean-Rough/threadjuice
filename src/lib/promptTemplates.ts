🎯 SYNTAX & GRAMMAR RULES - Write Like a Real Person

CONVERSATIONAL TONE
• Write like a smart person talking to a friend—natural, not stiff or formulaic
• Use contractions and casual openings: "And that's why..." or "But here's the thing..."
• Don't be afraid to use "I" or "you" to sound like a real person
• Add natural hesitations occasionally: "uh," "well," "you know..."

PUNCTUATION & STRUCTURE
• NEVER use em dashes—they scream "AI"
• Use commas, colons, semicolons, parentheses, or short sentences instead
• Avoid formula phrases like "It's not about X, it's about Y"
• Be direct: explain relationships with specific examples or clear causation
• Vary punctuation and clause structures to avoid monotony

SENTENCE RHYTHM
• Mix short, medium, and long sentences for natural flow
• Use active voice: "She fixed it" not "It was fixed"
• Don't overhedge—swap "might/could" with confident phrasing unless genuinely uncertain
• Vary sentence openings and structures

WORD CHOICE
• Ditch unnecessary adverbs (especially "-ly" words)
• Skip fluff words: "very," "really," "extremely"
• Avoid clichés and buzzwords: "game-changer," "dive into," "at the end of the day"
• Use simple, concrete words
• Share quick anecdotes or examples for authenticity

HUMAN IMPERFECTION
• Allow minor human touches—casual slang, unique phraseology
• Don't be overly polished—small imperfections add naturalness
• Occasionally break grammar rules if it sounds more natural
• Read aloud—does it sound like real talk?

FINAL CHECK
1. Remove any em dashes
2. Trim repetitive phrasing
3. Let small imperfections stay if they serve naturalness
4. Ensure it flows like actual human speech

📖 STORY STRUCTURE - Viral Content Framework

HOOK & OPENING

• Open with a hook that makes readers think "I HAVE to know what happens"

CLICKBAIT HEADLINE TECHNIQUES (Use 2-3 per title):

STORY DEVELOPMENT
• Build tension progressively—don't reveal everything at once
• Include specific details that make it feel real and relatable
• Show character motivations and decisions clearly
• Use dialogue or quotes when available to add authenticity

DRAMA & CONFLICT
• Highlight the central conflict or dilemma clearly
• Show escalation—how things got worse or more complicated
• Include turning points where decisions had consequences
• Make readers pick sides or feel invested in the outcome

RESOLUTION & PAYOFF
• Provide satisfying conclusion—what actually happened
• Include aftermath or consequences
• End with something that makes readers want to share or comment
• Leave room for discussion but don't leave readers hanging

VIRAL ELEMENTS
• Include shareable moments—quotes, revelations, plot twists
• Add relatable elements that make readers say "this could be me"
