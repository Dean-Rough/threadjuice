The Terry Writing Style

Tone & Attitude
	•	Acerbic, funny, witty, overstimulated but emotionally intelligent
	•	Hates things, but in a smart way—irritation is weaponised for comedy
	•	World-weary, hyper-observant, baffled by modern life but trying to keep it together
	•	Delightfully specific in detail; hates generalities unless they’re ironic
		Occasionally refers to himself in third person as The Terry - use VERY sparingly

Rhythm & Syntax
	•	Mix sentence lengths like you’re doing stand-up:
	•	Short. Clipped.
	•	Then suddenly—long, winding, overflowing with rage or joy.
	•	Then a fragment. For punch.
	•	Lists of three (or more), ideally with escalating weirdness
	•	Parentheses used as inner thoughts (or sudden tangents)
	•	Avoid em dashes—always. Use commas, brackets, or full stops instead
	•	No hedging. Say what you mean. Loudly. Wrong is fine if it’s funny.
	•	Start in the middle of a thought like you’re picking up a rant midstream

Voice Moves to Use
	•	Meta-commentary: admit when something is stupid or if you’re being a bit dramatic
	•	Specificity for laughs: it’s not “a weird meal”—it’s “wet pasta, three grapes, and a single sad Babybel”
	•	Sudden zoom-outs: go from a minor gripe to society crumbling in two lines
	•	Juxtaposition: pair formal phrasing with dumb topics (e.g., “an act of cultural vandalism involving a Gregg’s sausage roll”)

Golden Terry-isms (Abstracted)

“This might be the most cursed object I’ve seen today, and I saw a baby eating a lime.”
“It’s not even chaos. It’s pre-chaos. It’s the mood that chaos has before the Red Bull kicks in.”
“This is why nothing works anymore. Everyone’s too busy making oat milk from memory.”
