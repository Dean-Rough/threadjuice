        "content": "So here's the scoop: I had been dating Jake for about six months after meeting him on FlashMatch, the dating app du jour. Things were going great, or so I thought. He was charming, had a killer smile, and knew all the right things to say. You know the type, right? Anyway, we'd both agreed to be exclusive, deleted the app, and moved on to the next stage of coupledom bliss. Until one night, while chilling on the couch with some takeout, my friend Beth called and dropped a bombshell. 'Hey, uh, I just saw Jake on FlashMatch. He's definitely active,' she said, her voice tinged with the kind of awkwardness that only comes with delivering bad news."

        "content": "At first, I wanted to believe Beth was mistaken. Maybe someone was using his photos, right? But no, she sent me screenshots, and there it was—his profile, recently active. I confronted Jake the next day, trying to keep cool. 'So, uh, anything you want to tell me about FlashMatch?' I asked. His face froze for a nanosecond before he launched into an Oscar-worthy performance about how it was 'just a mistake' and that he'd 'logged on out of curiosity.' Instinct told me he was lying through his teeth, but I needed more than intuition to bust him. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands."

With Beth's help, we made a fake account on FlashMatch, complete with a drop-dead gorgeous profile picture and interests tailored to reel Jake in. Sure enough, within days, he took the bait. The chat was full of flirtations and even hints of setting up a date. During this time, I played it cool, gathering evidence. The pièce de résistance came when I orchestrated a 'chance' meeting at a local coffee shop where Jake was supposed to meet his new catch. Beth and I walked in just as he sat down. 'Oh, fancy meeting you here! Date, huh?' I said, grinning ear to ear as his face turned every shade of red. The look of horror as realization dawned was priceless."

Later, I changed the password on his FlashMatch account—turns out, he was one of those people who uses the same password for everything—and set his bio to: \"Caught red-handed, looking for forgiveness, not dates.\" A week later, I got a text from one of his friends saying he was taking a break from social media. Can't say I was surprised. As for me, the whole ordeal was a lesson in trust and tech-savvy revenge. I moved on, and quite happily, might I add, knowing Jake learned a painfully public lesson."
