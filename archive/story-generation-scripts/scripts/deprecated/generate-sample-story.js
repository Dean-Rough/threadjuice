      intro: `Oh, Twitter. Just when I think I've seen peak food discourse, along comes @chef_realness with a take so spicy it could season that $50 steak he's gatekeeping.

For those who missed the culinary carnage, our protagonist decided Wednesday evening was the perfect time to declare war on ketchup enthusiasts everywhere. His crime? Suggesting that anyone who dares to enhance their expensive beef with the humble tomato condiment has the "palate of a 5-year-old."`,

      main_narrative: `The tweet that launched a thousand dinner table arguments racked up 567 likes and 234 increasingly unhinged replies within hours. But here's where it gets interesting - the quote tweet ratio. 156 people felt compelled to share this take with their own commentary, and let me tell you, none of it was agreeing.

The responses ranged from the predictable ("imagine gatekeeping condiments in 2024") to the absolutely unhinged ("this is why the restaurant industry is dying"). My personal favorite came from @steaklover2024: "Gordon Ramsay uses ketchup and he's worth more than your entire kitchen."

Plot twist: Gordon Ramsay has never publicly endorsed ketchup on steak, but facts weren't really the point here.`,

      the_escalation: `What started as food snobbery quickly devolved into class warfare. Suddenly we had tweets about "elitist chef culture," "working-class condiment shaming," and someone genuinely arguing that ketchup discrimination is a form of economic oppression.

@workingmomof3 summed it up perfectly: "Some of us can't afford $50 steaks but when we do get a nice cut, we'll put whatever the hell we want on it, thanks."

The irony? Anthony (our chef protagonist) works at a mid-tier steakhouse in Ohio. We're not exactly talking Michelin star territory here.`,

      the_aftermath: `By Thursday morning, #KetchupGate was trending in food circles. Local news picked it up. Someone created a Change.org petition (yes, really) demanding "condiment equality in fine dining."

The final count: 567 likes, 234 replies, 89 retweets, and 156 quote tweets of pure chaos. Anthony later clarified he was "just joking around," but the internet had already moved on to its next food fight.`,

      conclusion: `The moral of the story? Twitter doesn't do nuance, especially when it comes to food. What could have been a lighthearted preference became a full-scale cultural debate about class, taste, and who gets to decide what's "proper" dining etiquette.

Also, for the record: if you're paying $50 for a steak and it needs ketchup to taste good, the problem isn't your palate - it's the chef.`
