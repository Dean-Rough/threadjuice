      intro: `Oh, Food Twitter. Just when I thought we'd exhausted every possible culinary controversy, along comes @culinary_truth with a ranch pizza take so inflammatory it could season the very dough it's criticizing.

For those who missed today's cafeteria culture wars, our protagonist decided Thursday morning was the perfect time to declare that ranch-on-pizza enthusiasts are living reminders of middle school mediocrity. Bold strategy.`,

      main_drama: `The tweet that launched a thousand lunch tray memories garnered 421 likes and 189 increasingly personal replies within the hour. But here's where it gets spicy - the quote tweet ratio tells the real story.

134 people felt compelled to share this take with their own commentary, ranging from "imagine gatekeeping happiness" to deeply personal confessions about childhood food trauma. My personal favorite came from @ranch_defender: "This person definitely ate sad desk salads in high school and it shows."

The responses escalated from food preferences to full psychological profiles. Suddenly everyone was a forensic analyst of cafeteria behavior patterns.`,

      the_fallout: `What started as condiment shaming quickly devolved into class warfare disguised as taste discourse. Quote tweets included:

‚Ä¢ "Tell me you grew up with a full spice rack without telling me"
‚Ä¢ "Ranch pizza slaps and your bougie taste buds can cope"  
‚Ä¢ "Some of us didn't have access to 'authentic' Italian cuisine, Karen"
‚Ä¢ "Middle school cafeteria food was better than whatever artisanal nonsense you're gatekeeping"

The irony wasn't lost on observers that a conversation about "questionable taste" became an exercise in questionable social media judgment.`,

      conclusion: `By noon, #RanchGate was trending in food circles. Local pizza places started posting ranch-positive content. Someone created a GoFundMe for "Ranch Pizza Acceptance Therapy."

The final tally: 421 likes, 189 replies, 67 retweets, and 134 quote tweets of pure condiment chaos. Alexandra later clarified she was "obviously joking," but the internet had already chosen violence.

The moral? Twitter doesn't do food nuance. What could have been a lighthearted preference became a full-scale examination of class, access, and why we let strangers on the internet dictate our pizza enjoyment.

Also, for the record: if ranch makes you happy, put ranch on your pizza. Life's too short to let Food Twitter ruin your lunch.`
