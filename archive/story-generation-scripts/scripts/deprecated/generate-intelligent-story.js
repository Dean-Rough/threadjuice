Too bad none of it was true. Not the grandma, not the kitchen, not even the cat photobombing the prep shots.

Food Twitter assembled like the Avengers of culinary justice. The evidence mounted: Ashley's "secret ingredient passed down through generations" was listed in the exact same quirky way Grace wrote it: "a whisper of white pepper (yes, a whisper, Grandma was very specific)."

Grace Liu hadn't posted in six months due to health issues, which made the theft even more egregious. Her granddaughter found out when followers started messaging asking why her grandma was now calling herself Ashley.`
