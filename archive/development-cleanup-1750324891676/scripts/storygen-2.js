  title:
    "AITA for putting my neighbor's Amazon packages in a decoy box filled with cat litter?",
  selftext: `So I (32M) live in an apartment complex and packages get stolen constantly. My neighbor Dave (??M) has been stealing packages from our mailroom for MONTHS. I've seen him on the security camera footage that the building manager showed me, but they "can't do anything without more evidence."

Last week, Dave stole my new headphones (¬£200) that I'd been saving up for. That was the last straw.

So I ordered a cheap item online and had it delivered in a big box. Then I filled the box with used cat litter from my friend's cats - just the clumping clay stuff, nothing dangerous. I wrote "EXPENSIVE ELECTRONICS" on the outside and left it in the mailroom.

Sure enough, Dave took it. I watched him through my peephole as he carried it to his apartment, grinning like he'd won the lottery.

About an hour later, I heard the most beautiful sound - Dave screaming "WHAT THE F***" through the thin walls. He came pounding on my door demanding to know if I put cat litter in "his" package.

I told him that if he hadn't stolen my package, he wouldn't have found out what was in it. He threatened to call the police, so I told him to go ahead - I'd love to explain to them how he knew what was in a package that wasn't addressed to him.

He stormed off and now half the building thinks I'm a genius and the other half thinks I went too far. My girlfriend says it was "disproportionate revenge" but honestly, I'm just tired of having my stuff stolen.
