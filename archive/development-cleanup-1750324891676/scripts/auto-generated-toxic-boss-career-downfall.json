He was the poster child for every corporate nightmare—a man who believed in the 'power of synergy' almost as much as he believed in never letting anyone leave work before 8 PM. I was Jane, his unfortunate assistant, who was apparently hired to be his verbal punching bag under the guise of 'office assistant'. On my first day, he introduced himself with, 'I don’t do incompetence. Make sure I don’t see any of yours.' Welcome to the company indeed."

One fine Friday, he decided my weekend could be spent redoing a presentation because, in his words, 'it lacks the sparkle of corporate excellence.' My breaking point came when he publicly berated me for not having read his mind about a meeting reschedule. As he stormed into his glass office, fuming, I decided it was high time someone taught Mr. Overlord a lesson in corporate karma."

The pièce de résistance? An email he sent, stating, 'It's not harassment if I call it motivation.' With a carefully compiled dossier and a strategically scheduled email to HR and the board, I waited. The following Wednesday, just as Mr. Overlord was about to deliver his quarterly 'We're Family' speech, his phone buzzed. Watching his face blanch as he read the email was an unexpected bonus. As he was escorted out of the building, I couldn’t help but wave. 'Good luck with all that synergy, sir,' I murmured as he passed."

The HR department started an 'anonymous' suggestion box which, ironically, wasn't anonymous when they installed it right next to the coffee machine. A week later, I was called into the office of the new interim manager, a remarkable woman named Sarah. 'I hear your organizational skills are impeccable,' she said with a wink. With Mr. Overlord gone, the company culture began to resemble something more like a workplace and less like a survival camp. And me? I got promoted. After all, someone had to keep the synergy going."
