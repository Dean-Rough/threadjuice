To the world, she's living her best life, always on a tropical vacation, with a wardrobe to die for and a lifestyle that seems like a never-ending dream. To the family, though, she's just Jessica, the girl who still hasn't moved out of her mom's basement and somehow thinks posing in front of a parked Maserati makes her an influencer. Our family reunion was coming up, and let's just say, the anticipation of seeing Jess try to keep up appearances was more entertaining than any reality TV. My aunt, Jess's mom, was hosting, and the entire extended family was invited. I was asked to help organize the event, which gave me a front-row seat to Jess's shenanigans. Little did she know, I was about to blow her cover."

Jessica arrived fashionably late, draped in what she called an 'authentic Gucci ensemble,' but it looked more like a Guccci with an extra 'c.' She was instantly the center of attention, narrating her latest 'trip to Bali' with photoshopped pictures that had even the least observant family members squinting in skepticism. While she was busy spinning her tales of luxury, I noticed her phone buzzing non-stop with Instagram notifications, each more sycophantic than the last. 'Your life is goals!' 'How can I be you?' they read. It was nauseating. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I set up a private Instagram story for family eyes only and started gathering evidence."

She staged a live stream, angling the camera to capture the rented decorations and gourmet caterer my aunt had hired. The facade was sickening. So, during her most recent live stream, I decided to give her audience a reality check. 'Hey Jess, isn't it great that Aunt Linda's Maserati is parked right outside? Perfect for your next photoshoot!' I said loud enough for the camera’s mic to pick it up. Jess's eyes widened as she struggled to mute the stream without looking suspicious. But the comments section was already lighting up. 'Wait, that's not hers?' one follower wrote. 'Didn't she say she owned a Maserati?' another questioned. As panic set in, I posted the private story showing behind-the-scenes footage. The unedited version of her 'Bali trip' was actually a green screen app from her phone. And guess what? Her 'Gucci' haul was from a local thrift store. The final nail in the coffin was a video of her rehearsing her 'spontaneous' live speech in front of a mirror. The family was watching the unraveling unfold live, jaws dropping in unison."

Her live stream turned into a riot of disbelief and outrage, and she quickly ended the broadcast in tears. The family, meanwhile, found the whole thing deeply cathartic, having long tired of her antics. 'Finally, some truth!' my uncle exclaimed, as the room erupted into laughter. Aunt Linda, though embarrassed, thanked me for putting an end to the charade. Jess retreated to her basement lair, her empire of lies in ruins. On social media, she rebranded herself as a 'Simplicity Advocate,' but the damage was done. She was no longer the Queen of Insta; she was just 'Jessica from the Block.' I might have lost a few followers myself, but the satisfaction of exposing the truth was worth more than any number of likes."
