Things were going great, or so she thought. One evening, while she was hanging out with her friends, she received a DM from a stranger on Instagram. 'Hey, is this your boyfriend?' the message read, followed by a screenshot from Tinder showing Mark's profile. Lisa's heart dropped. Mark had assured her he deleted his Tinder profile months ago. She decided to do some sleuthing before making any accusations."

'Up for some fun?' Her blood boiled, but she played it cool. 'Definitely. What are you looking for?' she replied. Mark spun a tale of being single and 'just looking to meet new people.' Furious but determined, Lisa set up a date with him, using a fake name. The plot was set. She knew she wanted to confront him face-to-face but needed a plan to make the impact unforgettable."

Mark’s eyes widened in shock. 'Lisa?! What the—' he stammered. 'I just wanted to meet this amazing guy I heard so much about,' she said, sarcasm dripping from every word. With all eyes on them, she opened her phone and showed him the screenshots from Tinder and Instagram. 'Care to explain?' The cafe was silent as Mark fumbled for words, his cheeks burning with embarrassment."

Meanwhile, Lisa felt liberated, having turned her heartbreak into a moment of empowerment. She realized her worth and that she deserved someone who would respect her. Not long after, she started dating again and met someone genuine on a different platform, proving that sometimes karma comes back around perfectly."
