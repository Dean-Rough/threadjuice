Her idea of a wild Friday night is a new book, comfy PJs, and a steaming cup of tea. Adventure to her was within the pages of her latest read, until she decided to dip her toes into the chaotic world of online dating. She matched with Derek, a charismatic personal trainer with a 'swoon-worthy' smile and a knack for sweet talk. It was like Beauty met the Beast, minus the enchanted castle and talking furniture."

He was vague about his past relationships and his phone might as well have been an extension of his hand, always buzzing with notifications. Yet, Julia, smitten as she was, chose to ignore these signs. That was until she saw a comment on one of Derek’s Instagram posts, from a girl named Chloe: 'Last night was amazing, babe. Round two tonight?'. The comment was swiftly deleted, but not before Julia took a screenshot."

She popped open her laptop, turned on her 'detective mode', and started digging. Using Chloe's Instagram, she uncovered two more girls who seemed a little too close to Derek. Julia wasted no time and messaged them. As they swapped stories, it became crystal clear: Derek was a cheater, juggling multiple relationships with the grace of a seasoned performer. But Julia had the proof, and she hatched a plan. She created a group chat with all the girls, including Chloe, and caught Derek off-guard one evening with a video call. Derek answered, expecting Julia, but instead was greeted by the faces of his entire ensemble. As the girls confronted him with their collective evidence, our sweet talker was reduced to a stammering mess."

She compiled all the screenshots, video call recording, and Derek’s sweet-talking messages into a single post, which she shared on every platform she could think of. The post went viral as the 'Swiping Right on Sweet Revenge' saga, and Derek was bombarded with messages from outraged netizens. Julia, Chloe, and the rest of the girls, though hurt, found solace in their supportive new friendship and the sweet taste of justice. As for Derek, let's just say his dating life took quite the hit after his manipulative antics were laid bare for all to see."
