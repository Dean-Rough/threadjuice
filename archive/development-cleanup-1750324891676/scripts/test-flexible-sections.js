  selftext: `So this happened last week and my family is losing their minds. My grandmother passed away last year and left me (25F) her entire estate - about $180k plus her house. She specifically wrote in her will that it all goes to me because I was the only grandchild who stayed in touch and visited her regularly.

My stepbrother Jake (28M) has been asking for money constantly since he found out. He wants half the inheritance to start a business. My mom thinks I should "share" because we're family. But here's the thing - Jake never even talked to grandma. He skipped every family gathering and didn't even come to her funeral.

Yesterday at family dinner, Jake brought his girlfriend and they basically ganged up on me saying I'm being selfish and that grandma "didn't really know what she was doing" when she wrote the will. 

I told them exactly what I thought about that and left. Now everyone's blowing up my phone saying I'm tearing the family apart over money.

AITA?`,
